Description: Nginx Development Kit module
 The NDK is an Nginx module that is designed to extend the core functionality of
 the excellent Nginx webserver in a way that can be used as a basis of other
 Nginx modules.
 .
 It has functions and macros to deal with generic tasks that don't currently
 have generic code as part of the core distribution. The NDK itself adds few
 features that are seen from a user's point of view - it's just designed to help
 reduce the code that Nginx module developers need to write.
